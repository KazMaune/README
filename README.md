Hello there, I’m Kaz, I’m a junior software engineer and I just recently graduated
from LaunchCode's web dev boot camp. I enjoy developing applications that
use Typescript and Angular though I am eager to learn any JavaScript
framework.

After I went into their Liftoff program, I built a full-stack project with a team of 6,
which eventually dwindled to 4. Our app utilized Typescript, Angular and
Bootstrap for the front-end and Java, Spring Boot, Hibernate ORM and Json web
tokens for our back-end. During this project I built a lot of our front end, handling
our API calls to our back-end, setting up our user auth in the front-end, and even
adding a way for users to save, edit and delete multiple templates as well as
query the Edamame API to bring up random recipes based on the ingredients
they entered.

Here is a link to the deployed frontend version! It is currently a wip as I am learning AWS to deploy it with a backend, too.

You can find the code for this app in my starred repositories, it's name is FeedMe!

Currently, I am learning React, Next.js, PostgreSQL and Prisma using online
tutorial videos and other resources.

I would enjoy a role that is front-end focused but I am eager to learn more and
delve into the back-end for a full stack role.
